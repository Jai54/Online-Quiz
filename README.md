Technology Used:- I used Java as the core technology to maintain the front view part of my Project, I am using JSP, HTML, CSS, and JS. To handle the server request i used servlet And for backend recards i used MYSQL database to store my data in database. i used Model package to maintain the database transactions and write common code to connect database in the properties file with the help of JDBC ( JAVA DATABASE CONNCETIVITY). So i used this technology to my Project.

Servlet:-

I am using Servlet as a server-side programming language. Which is responsible to handle the request which is coming from the view part. As we are using MVC architecture so the controller part would be handle by the only servlet by the post and Get methods.
